<h3>Instructions</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Press 'space' to start and restart the game.</li>
    <li>The white platforms are your key to survival!</li>
    <li>Use the arrow keys (left, right, up) and space to bounce the black box (The Action Box) safely between platforms.</li>
    <li>Try to get the highest score you can without touching the ground.</li>
    <li><b>Powerups</b></li>
    <ul>
        <li>Powerups are coloured boxes that fall from the sky that provide special abilities.</li>
        <li>Activate a powerup by moving the action box over it.</li>
        <li>A powerup will activate for a random amount of time and they will vary in power.</li>
        <li>More valuable powerups are smaller and therefore more difficult to attain.</li>
        <li>Blue powerups will lower gravity, making it easier to glide between platforms.</li>
        <li>Red powerups will add a points multiplier</li>
    </ul>
